# Iconic - Vanilla

###### _Original author: [Conj](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17254)_
### _Tested with 1.17.1 (Turtle - Nordanaar)_


Iconic integrates into Blizzard's default Macro UI. There are no slash commands, no setup, and no preferences to mess with. Simply open up your macro window with /macro, write your macro, name it, then when you go to choose your icon use Iconic's search bar (left of the "Okay" button) to help narrow things down!
